# Test Suite Architecture and Implementation Guide

## Core Implementation Requirements

### State Management
- Interface: IssueState
  - error: string
  - file: string
  - created: Date
  - completed: Date
  - category: ErrorCategory
  - context: string
  - metrics?: NetworkMetrics
  - priority?: number
  - impact?: string
  - reproductionSteps?: string[]

### File System Structure
- /project-state
  - structure.json: Current project structure snapshot
  - functions.json: Function/type name registry
  - ISSUES.md: Active issues with LLM context
  - history.json: Complete test history with atomic updates
  - backup/: State backup directory
    - state-{timestamp}.json: Timestamped state backups
    - locks/: Concurrent access lock files

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum test coverage: 80%
- Test categories required:
  - Unit tests for all utilities
  - Integration tests for services
  - E2E tests for workflows
  - Component tests for UI
  - Performance tests for critical paths
- Test file naming: {feature}.{type}.test.ts
- One test file per feature/component
- Maximum test file size: 150 lines

### Error Handling Requirements
- Protocol Support:
  - HTTP/HTTPS errors
  - WebSocket errors
  - Process errors
  - Runtime errors
  - Compiler errors
  - Type errors
  - Console errors
  - Uncaught errors
- Error Categories:
  - Build errors (webpack, typescript)
  - Runtime errors (node, browser)
  - Network errors (http, ws)
  - Integration errors (api, db)
  - Component errors (react, vue)
  - Performance errors (memory, cpu)
- Error Context:
  - Stack trace
  - Source location
  - Error type
  - Severity level
  - Impact assessment
  - Resolution steps

### File System Operations
- Atomic Operations:
  - Write with backup
  - Rollback on failure
  - Lock management
  - Concurrent access control
- State Management:
  - Differential updates
  - Version control
  - Conflict resolution
  - State validation

### Performance Requirements
- Memory limits:
  - Per test: 512MB
  - Total suite: 2GB
- Execution time limits:
  - Unit tests: 5s
  - Integration tests: 30s
  - E2E tests: 120s
- Resource monitoring:
  - CPU usage tracking
  - Memory allocation
  - File system operations
  - Network requests
  - Test execution time

### Quality Standards
- Code organization:
  - Maximum file size: 150 lines
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Functional programming patterns
  - Type safety enforcement
- Error handling:
  - Comprehensive error types
  - Proper error propagation
  - Context preservation
  - Recovery mechanisms
- Performance:
  - Resource cleanup
  - Memory management
  - Execution optimization
  - Parallel processing
